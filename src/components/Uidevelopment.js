            <p><b>what is UI development</b></p>
            <p>A UI developerâ€™s role is to translate creative software design concepts and ideas into reality using front end technology. They understand the user interface design solution both in its practical intent and creative vision, and convert it into engineered softwares. A UI Developer is the bridge between presentation layer and the backend layer, who understands both and creates a niche as the translational layer in between, so that both lives up to its full potential and are not compromised because of each other.</p>
