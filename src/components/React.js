            <p><b>what is ReactJS</b></p>
            <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is an open-source, front end, JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces or UI components. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing.[7][8] React Router[9] is an example of such a library. And also large and complicated applications are required to make AJAX calls to fetch or mutate data. You can use any library you like with React such as Axios, JQuery AJAX or the browser built-in window.fetch.</p>
